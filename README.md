# LinkedList
This is a simple implementation of a Linked List using templates. In the future it will hopefully be more optimized in function and will use correct copies and returns for proper C++ functionality. Will not use latest C++ changes in memory management, I'm trying to avoid any overhead of reference counting that the libraries provide.
